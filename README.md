*DESCRITION*:
REST API Client in Java
This repository contains a Java application that demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests and parse JSON responses. The program consumes a public REST API (e.g., fetching weather data) and displays the retrieved data in a structured format.

Key Features:
HTTP Request Handling:

Sends GET requests to a public REST API using HttpURLConnection.

Supports fetching data from any RESTful API endpoint.

JSON Parsing:

Uses the org.json library to parse JSON responses.

Extracts and displays specific fields from the JSON data.

Structured Output:

Displays the API response in a clean, readable format.

Example: Fetches weather data and shows temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

Simple and Lightweight:

No external dependencies other than the org.json library.

Easy to understand and extend for other APIs.

Example Use Case:
The application fetches weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity in a structured format.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.

Replace the API endpoint and API key (if required) in the code.

Run the program to fetch and display data from the REST API.

Technologies Used:

HttpURLConnection for HTTP requests
org.json for JSON parsing
